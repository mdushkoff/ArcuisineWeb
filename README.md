# ArcuisineWeb
Arcuisine is an application that can optimally choose a restaurant location near you and your friends that everyone can enjoy!  It takes into account each of your likes and dislikes as well as your previous restaurant experiences in order to give you a simple way of deciding a place where everyone will like.  In the backend, Arcuisine uses "Adaptive Regression" which is a machine learning technique that predicts what you and all of your friends will love based on all of your previous experiences, and your personal tastes.
